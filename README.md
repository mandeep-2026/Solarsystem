Solar System Design ü™ê-----

An interactive and educational model of the solar system, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to be a fun and engaging way to visualize the planets' orbits, allowing users to control the speed and zoom level.

The main objective was to create a lightweight, single-page application that showcases the power of fundamental web technologies to build dynamic and animated content without any external libraries.

Technologies Used----

HTML: Provides the core structure for the application, including the planets, the Sun, and the user interface controls. Each celestial body is an HTML element that can be manipulated by JavaScript and styled with CSS.


CSS: The heart of the visualization's design. CSS is used to:

Create the orbits using border and border-radius.

Style the planets with gradients and shadows to give them a three-dimensional appearance.

Power the celestial animations, including the twinkle effect for the background stars and the transform: rotate() property for the planets' orbits.



JavaScript: The interactive backbone of the project. JavaScript handles all user input and dynamic behavior, such as:

Adjusting the orbit speed with a slider.

Toggling planet labels on and off.

Implementing keyboard controls to pause and reset the simulation.

Enabling a parallax effect on the background stars as the user moves their mouse, adding depth to the scene.
